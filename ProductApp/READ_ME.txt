Apply the following changes (if needed):

1) If using other than MySQL database, then update the dependencies in the pom file.
2) In the application.properties change the schema with login/password.

Run the sql file located in the 'resources' folder.

Besides that I have added one additional feature, which allows to view the product
category description of a certain product.
